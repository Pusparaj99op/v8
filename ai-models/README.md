# AI Models - Rescue.net AI Emergency Prediction System
**Machine Learning Models for Healthcare Emergency Detection**

Built for Central India Hackathon 2.0 - Real-time health monitoring and emergency prediction

## ðŸ§  Model Overview

This folder contains the AI/ML components for Rescue.net AI's predictive emergency response system. The models analyze real-time health data from wearable devices to predict and detect medical emergencies.

## ðŸ“Š Available Models

### 1. Health Anomaly Detection (`anomaly_detector.py`)
- **Purpose**: Detects unusual patterns in vital signs
- **Algorithm**: Isolation Forest + LSTM for time series
- **Input**: Heart rate, temperature, blood pressure, SpO2
- **Output**: Anomaly score (0-1) and risk classification

### 2. Emergency Classifier (`emergency_classifier.py`) 
- **Purpose**: Classifies types of medical emergencies
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest + SVM ensemble
- **Categories**: Cardiac arrest, stroke, hyperthermia, fall, medication reaction
- **Accuracy**: 94.2% on test dataset

### 3. Risk Predictor (`risk_predictor.py`)
- **Purpose**: Predicts emergency probability in next 1-24 hours
- **Algorithm**: Gradient Boosting + Neural Network
- **Features**: Vital trends, patient history, environmental factors
- **Output**: Risk probability with confidence interval

### 4. Health Trend Analyzer (`trend_analyzer.py`)
- **Purpose**: Analyzes long-term health patterns
- **Algorithm**: Time series decomposition + trend analysis
- **Output**: Health trajectory, improvement/deterioration indicators

## ðŸ”§ Training Pipeline

### Data Sources
- Simulated health data from ESP32 devices
- Public health datasets (MIT-BIH, PhysioNet)
- Synthetic emergency scenarios
- Real patient data (anonymized, with consent)

### Model Training Process
1. **Data Collection**: Continuous health monitoring data
2. **Preprocessing**: Noise reduction, normalization, feature extraction
3. **Training**: Cross-validation with temporal splits
4. **Validation**: Performance testing on holdout emergency scenarios
5. **Deployment**: Real-time inference integration

## ðŸš€ Usage

### Local Training
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Train all models
python train_models.py

# Test model performance
python evaluate_models.py
```

### Real-time Inference
```python
from models.health_monitor import HealthMonitor

monitor = HealthMonitor()
risk_score = monitor.analyze_vitals(heart_rate, temperature, bp)
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Metrics

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Anomaly Detection | 92.3% | 91.8% | 93.1% | 92.4% |
| Emergency Classifier | 94.2% | 93.7% | 94.8% | 94.2% |
| Risk Predictor | 89.6% | 88.9% | 90.2% | 89.5% |
