This is a Prototype project for the Central India Hackathon 2.0, aiming to create a predictive emergency response system that leverages AI/ML, IoT, and real-time communication to save lives. The platform is designed to predict medical emergencies before they occur and coordinate intelligent responses through a comprehensive ecosystem of hardware, software,using ESP32, Arduino Nano, and various sensors for real-time health monitoring, the system integrates with a patient web dashboard and hospital web dashborard to provide critical health insights and emergency alerts. The backend services are built using Node.js and Python, with a focus on hackathon and working.

TECHNICAL STACK:
- Frontend: React Native, React.js (web dashboard)
- Backend: Node.js with Express, local ollama AI/ML Local training (use this laptop is server)
- Database: MongoDB (user data), PostgreSQL (structured data)
- AI/ML: TensorFlow.js, scikit-learn, real-time health pattern analysis
- Real-time: Socket.io, WebRTC for emergency communications
- Cloud: AWS/Google Cloud Platform
- APIs: Google Maps, Twilio SMS, government health APIs

CORE FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:
1. Health Monitoring & AI Prediction Engine, patient learning from real-time data
2. Analysis and Prediction of Measure Issues by Symptoms, Emergency Detection & Alert System
3. Real-time Response Coordination and location sharing to hospitals and ambulances
4. Hospital/Ambulance Dashboard
5. AI Predictive Analytics Dashboard

Instructions for Copilot:
- make sure codes should look like typed by a human, not AI generated.
- keep workspace organized with clear folder structure
- avoid creating unnecessary files or folders
- always comment in the start of the file about the file purpose and should look like a human written comment
- Focus on working, must work fine, 
- keep in mind this is a prototype project, for the Central India Hackathon 2.0
- two webdashboards: one for hospitals and one for patients
- AI should learn from real-time data, must understand health patterns, symtopms and predict emergencies by analyzing health data
- Use real-time data from wearable devices and sensors
- Build for India-specific requirements (multilingual, offline capability)

WHEN I ASK FOR HELP:
- Provide Working Code: Ensure the code is working with proper error handling should look human written.
- Optimize for performance and 24/7 availability


<!-- "I'm working on Rescue.net AI, a predictive emergency response platform. I need help with [specific feature/component]. 

Current status: [Brief description of what's already built]
Goal: [What you want to achieve in this session]
Technical requirements: [Specific technologies or constraints]


    examine my workspace then understand the context of the project.and tell me if anything is left to do or if anything is missing. and also tell me project stats

there are 30 problems in this project which are not solved yet. fix them one by one. then


Please provide production-ready code with proper error handling and documentation." -->
